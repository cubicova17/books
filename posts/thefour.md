I’ve finished reading this book, and don’t even know whom to suggest it to) Perhaps, to the readers who see large IT corporations through rose-tinted glasses. Just as I did before reading it. I am now arriving at an understanding that these giants should be decomposed into smaller companies.

“The Four” is a ruthless criticism and a micro-chronicle of the FAAG. The author does a great job of showing all the components making the business models of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google successful, however, the book lacks a deeper dive into the DNA/culture itself. As an example, the topics of Amazon’s “obsession with the client”, Google’s engineering culture, or Apple’s designer culture are neglected completely.

The main value of the book is an effort to describe the macro trends the four is standing on, their business models, and narratives. This, Scott has managed really well. It is full of interesting facts, jokes, and legends of when the author himself was present at the board meetings.

At the end of the book, there’s almost a word for word part of his Algebra of Happiness, which, at the end of the day, is more applicable.
Scott Galloway is an epic person, successful entrepreneur, and lecturer at NYU. A bit of a troll and an eccentric individual. He is a capitalist, dubbed a socialist by the republicans. He does yearly IT industry forecasts, which mostly come true, highly recommend his blog "No Mercy / No Malice"
