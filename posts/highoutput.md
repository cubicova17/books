"High output management" - is the first (but not only) booküìö I recommend to the future managers. If I would be asked to summarize it‚Äôs key ideas, they would be:
- A manager's output = the output of his organization + the output of the neighboring organizations under his influence. I was asked a few times by my peers: "How do you measure the efficiency of the Engineering manager? What are his OKRs?". What I found organically is the same as Andy's formula. 

- Managerial Output = Activity x Leverage. To increase their output managers can: a) Increase the rate at which an activity is done, b) Increase the leverage achieved in an activity, c) Shift from lower leverage activities to higher leverage activities. The art of management is to select activities with the highest leverage and perform them wellüí°.

- Motivation vs. Ability. When a person is not doing their job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can‚Äôt do it or won't do it; they are either not capable or not motivated. And there is a very simple mental test to determine which one is the case. If the person's life would depend upon completing the job, would they be able to do it? If the answer is ‚Äúyes‚Äù - it means the skill is there, but motivation is notüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. If ‚Äúno‚Äù, means even if the person is motivated, they are unable to do it.

There is a certain logic in recommending older books before the newer ones. The reader will understand what a huge leap our industry has made before we‚Äôve got to where we are) Interestingly, not so many things have changed. I found a lot of ideas from Andy Groove to be popular now, rephrased by other people:

- "In-process inspection vs functional test" analogy reminds me of an approach popularized by Booking.com, where they got rid of testing quality gates (In-process inspection) for the sake of the functional test (have some amount of traffic which will have errors but will detect problems). The same idea is developed further into the concept of "gate-like inspection" vs. "monitoring". Basically 

- Andy Groove actually created a concept of OKRs evolving them from MBOs. This idea was only further developed by John Doerr in his "Measure what matters".

- Hybrid Organizations and Dual reporting ideas were wrapped up and prettified into what we know as the Spotify Model. All the problems and benefits are the same in either case)
